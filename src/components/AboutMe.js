                    Hi! I'm Zack and I am a full stack developer from Atlanta, Georgia.
                    I began learning code after the 2020 corona virus pandemic left me without a job
                    for months and I became determined to learn a skill that would allow me to
                    contribute to the world without being in physical contact with it. Since then
                    I have loved my journey to become a developer and can't wait to build and
                    design more wonderful projects with the online community.
                </p>
